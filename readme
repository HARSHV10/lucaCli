# LucaCli

**LucaCli** turns your natural language requests into shell commands using local LLMs (Ollama) or OpenAI. It features built-in safety guardrails to prevent accidental deletion of files.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Installation)

### Windows
1.  **Run the Installer**:
    Open PowerShell and run:
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
    ```
2.  **Restart your Terminal**

### Linux / macOS
1.  **Run the Installer**:
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    ```
2.  **Restart your Terminal** (or source your shell rc file).

## 🛠️ Configuration

Before first use, tell Luca which AI to use (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini):

```bash
luca --setup
```

## 💻 Usage

Just type `luca` followed by what you want to do:

```bash
luca "create a new React project in a folder called app"
```

```bash
luca "list all python files"
```

```bash
luca "list all python files"
```

### 🧠 Smart Q&A (New!)
You can ask Luca questions about your project. It will run the necessary commands and give you a natural language answer.

```bash
luca "what git branch am i on?"
# Luca runs 'git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD'
# Answer: You are currently on the 'main' branch.
```

### 💡 General Knowledge
Luca can also answer general questions without running commands.

```bash
luca "what is 2 + 2"
# Answer: The answer is 4.
```

```bash
luca "explain git commit"
# Answer: git commit saves your changes to the local repository...
```

### 🛡️ Safety First
If you try something dangerous (like deleting files), Luca will **always** ask for confirmation first.

```bash
luca "delete the temp folder"
# WARNING: This command is flagged as DESTRUCTIVE.
# Are you sure you want to execute this? (type 'yes' to confirm):
```

## Manual Installation (Advanced)
If you prefer to install manually:
1.  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  `pip install -e .`
3.  Add the Python Scripts folder to your PATH manually.
